# My Sonic client

This crate is an incomplete implementation of a async *Rust* client for the [Sonic](https://github.com/valeriansaliou/sonic) project built with [Tokio](https://tokio.rs).

This is an experimental project (two working days) and not at all an official (and literal) implementation.

See [examples](examples/) for _how to use_.
